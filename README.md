# iplytics_diagrams
This repository contains some diagrams that could be useful for the system. Ideally the diagrams are generated by code to be able to track changes and allow easy contributions to the diagram evolution process.

To generate the diagrams from the code the initial library used is called [diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com). You can find its documentation in their website. In addition to it, their code is intuitive enough for you to find most of the components needed.
